Advent of code 2016

Working on the advent of code challenge for 2016 - http://adventofcode.com/2016

Half and half Groovy (to use some nice JDK8 stuff)/Python (to refresh my Python)

Probably not the best code in the world, but since I'm competing in a leaderboard it's mostly whatever works and is finished as fast as possible!
